This is a simple Python guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number. The program:

  Asks the user for the upper limit of the number range

  Generates a random number between 0 and that upper limit

  Prompts the user to guess until the number is guessed correctly

  Tells the user whether their guess is too high or too low

  Displays the number of attempts at the end
